    "The exercises done in this lab look into the general pipeline of ChIP-sequencing analysis. It shows how it is done, why it is important and most significantly what it tells you about the data. ChIP-sequencing is used to identify areas of the genome in noncoding regions and to determine what the sequences are as well as the function. The focus here is particualrly aimed at ChIP-sequence reads of three of the \"Yamanaka factors\" as well as a few other histone modification sites. The \"Yamanaka factors\" are a type of transcription factor and it has been shown that treatment of cells with these specific transcription factors can make cells \"pluripotent\" again. This means that they can unspecialize what a cell is such that it can be reprogrammed to any cell in its cell lines. "

It is interesting to see that for the transcription factors, the majority of the reads are falling in the noncoding regions of the sequence (upstream from Pou5f1). This makes sense since transcription factors are used in regulating the expression of genes. These areas hence can be promoter/enhacer regions. It is even more interesting to see that the histone modification reads are almost the inverse of the transcription factors. Areas where the histone modifications have large peaks the tf's are low and vice versa. The histone modifications also have peaks that fall into both the intron and exon portions of the gene Pou5f1. Lastly the control is shown to have reads mapped all over the place. Although there are some natural peaks occuring in similar spots as the tf's and histone sites. This makes sense since maybe these ares are just naturally more reachable and available to sequence and fragment. \n",

We are looking over a huge sequence of bases where repeats can be similar for short motifs. This would likely result in the same pattern found at numerous points in the chromosome. This might not explain for all of the matches along the chromosome however. Another reason could be the specific combination of amino acids (bases of 3) is very common among different proteins and family of proteins. These locations would be in coding regions of the chromosome. The motifs might also show up because other tf sites have similar sequenecs as well."
